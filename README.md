# Javascript-Practice

1. Anagram - Decided to use normalize() and replace() on the diacritics, in order to check a char is a char in as many non-symbol based languages as possible, BEFORE comparing if two phrases have the same number of characters
   
2. Most Frequent Char - Being from a python, pandas background, I wanted to work with dictionaries. To extract an array of frequencies from a dictionary, I went with ECMAScript 2015 rather than the 2017 method for extracting an array from dictionary Values.

3. Most Frequent Vowel - Created a generic RegExp builder for cases other than vowels. Enables user-specified character(s) in a) global, b) case-insensitive, and c) find ANY mode.
